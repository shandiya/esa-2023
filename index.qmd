[I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we meet, the Larrakia people, as well as the Traditional Owners of the lands on which I live and work, the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation. I pay my respects to their Elders past and present. I recognise the spiritual and cultural significance of land, water, and all that is in the environment to Traditional Owners, and their continuing connection to Country.]{.acknowledgement}
